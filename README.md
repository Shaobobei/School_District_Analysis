# School_District_Analysis

Maria and her supervisor has been tasked by the school borad to find out find if there are any evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School for the ninth graders, the grades appear to have been altered. We want replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once math and reading scores has been replaced, we will repeat the school district analysis that we did before and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
