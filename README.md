# School_District_Analysis

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that there seem to have evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. We want replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once math and reading scores has been replaced, we will repeat the school district analysis that we did before and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
